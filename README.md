### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A little bit about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Data Scientist mainly working on computer vision and deep reinforcement learning projects. I also like drones (a lot)
- ðŸ”¥ My favorite Deep Learning framework is PyTorch (Check my contribution(s) to their repository below)
- ðŸ‘¯ Most of my experience is in the automotive industry, however I am open to collaborate on any kind of projects


I can't wait to collaborate with you
