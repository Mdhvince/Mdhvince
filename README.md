### Hi there 👋

A little bit about me:

- 🔭 I’m a Data Scientist mainly working on computer vision and deep reinforcement learning projects. I also like drones (a lot)
- 🔥 My favorite Deep Learning framework is PyTorch (Check my contribution(s) to their repository below)
- 👯 Most of my experience is in the automotive industry, however I am open to collaborate on any kind of projects
